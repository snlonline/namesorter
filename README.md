How to run and test program:

 To be able to run the programs, you need these dependencies; dotnet SDK 8,

 The program assumes that the unsorted-names.txt file is present in the root
directory of the application.
 Should you wish to test your own names, replace that text file with the txt file of
your own names – bare in mind the name of the file should be the same.
 The program is using NUnit 4 for unit tests.
